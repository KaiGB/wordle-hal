For the first guess, the following are recommended in descending order.
 - 'trace': 150.00000000000006
 - 'crate': 147.9999999999998
 - 'parse': 146.00000000000102
 - 'slate': 145.99999999999972
 - 'crane': 141.99999999999875
 - 'heart': 141.0000000000005
 - 'stale': 141.00000000000009
 - 'least': 140.00000000000065

For inputting score, a green square should be a 2, an amber square should be a 1, and a grey square a 0.

As an example [grey grey grey amber green] -> 00012

Be aware that it may take up to 1 - 2 minutes to run the first guess where only grey tiles are returned. Don't panic! Hal is thinking.
